# ai-learning

As part of a research project, I'm going to explain what I'm learning about AI stuff.
Hopefully it will be useful.

## Characteristics of our game

It's a perfect information game - both players see the entire state of the game

It's a zero-sum game - if one player wins, the other loses

The state space is finite but quite large

The rules are deterministic - there is no random element in the gameplay

I have absolutely no knowledge about AI I’m just using AI models everyday to facilitate various tasks. To understand more I’m going to do the same thing that I’ve done when I started learning computer science : watching lectures of CS50.

## Definitions

agent : entitiy that perceives its environment and acts upon that environment

## Python

I’m working on Mac OS and I have issues with python packages (conflits between each others), so I discover differents tools to help me.
Tools installated :
pipx — Install and Run Python Applications in Isolated Environments
poetry - poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python.

## Project

The final goal is to find if this game as a winning strategy.
